Objective:
This C++ search engine is designed to efficiently handle and search a collection of documents.
It’s structured around key components: the DocumentParser, which extracts important terms and metadata; the IndexHandler, which organizes these terms in a self-balancing dsavltree for rapid retrieval; and the QueryProcessor, which interprets user queries, searches the index, and ranks results by relevance.
The SearchEngine orchestrates the full workflow — parsing documents, building the index, and executing searches — while the UserInterface provides a clean, simple way for users to input queries and view results.
By giving each module a focused role, the system stays efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.
